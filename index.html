            <p>Introversia 1492 melds two stories of isolation.</p>
            <p>First, we present the story of a lonely island with a cursed and mysterious past.</p><p>Rumor has it that at the heart of the island is a grumpy volcano—the embodiment of a notorious island King with an insatiable appetite for food ...and murder.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='story-item'>
            <p>When he was alive, the King’s people turned to food to cool his temper. If left unchecked, the King would blow his top and go on a murderous rampage …until one day his people had had enough and threw him into the volcano.</p><p>Merging with the volcano, the King’s temper still lives on and demands the attention and food of the island. </p><p>Feed him well and all ends well. Feed him badly and everything ends. PERIOD.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='story-item'>
            <p>Fearing the island’s voracious hunger, the islanders hoped to calm the volcano by carving into it a content and, more importantly, a well-fed Buddha. </p><p>Unfortunately, every hundred years or so—the last time was in 1918—the hunger from deep within the island becomes too great and the Buddha carved into the volcano transforms into “Hangry Buddha”.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='story-item'>
            <p>All the original inhabitants eventually fled together when they could not feed the island properly. Knowing the potential devastation awaiting any future inhabitants, the island’s diaspora worked hard to keep the location of the island a hidden secret. </p><p>They succeeded. It’s been uninhabited and hidden for the past 800 years. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='story-item'>
            <p>Fast forward to 2020 to our next story. For the past 5 years, Be By Yourself Enterprises (BBYE) has been selling remote, unmapped islands to extreme introverts, usually former-techie-turned-Luddite types.</p>
            <p>These unmapped, unnamed islands are simply referred to by their sequential codenames (i.e. ‘Introversia ##’) and have become harder and harder to come by. </p>
        </div>
        <div class='story-item'>
            <p>Introversia 1491 was the last island available for sell. </p>
            <p>That was almost 3 months ago… and desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='story-item'>
            <p>With the development of Introversia 1492, these two stories coalesce to become the story of the island’s next inhabitant, you!
            </p>
              <p>The last known descendant of those who fled the cursed island has agreed to sell to BBYE—on the condition that every future inhabitant be made aware of the island’s history and told how to satiate the Buddha-shaped volcano before he erupts.
